// These are the best movies based on their rates, so supposedly all of them have a remarkable rate. In this iteration, we want to know the average rate of all of them and display it on the console. Create a ratesAverage() function that receives an array as a parameter and solves the challenge.

// The rate must be returned rounded to 2 decimals!

// ğŸ’¡ Maybe you want to "reduce" the data to a single value. ğŸ˜‰

// Iteration 5: Drama movies - Get the average of Drama Movies

// Iteration 6: Time Format - Turn duration of the movies from hours to minutes

// BONUS Iteration: Best yearly rate average - Best yearly rate average
